    <h2>PHASE-0</h2>

    <p id="intro">As expected Phase-0 began with orientation ,requirement gathering and subsequently
        meeting the team.Phase-0 was was exciting all be it intensive .The curriculum is adapted from
        on <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank" >Flatiron School</a>
        The labs are set in such way that they almost resemble playing a game.
        There was a mission(pass a lab) with objection along the way
       (lab broken down into many test).
       In effect learning about problem decompostion even without realising it.</p>
